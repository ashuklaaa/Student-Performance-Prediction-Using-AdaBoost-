Student Performance Prediction using AdaBoost

This project implements a machine learning model to predict student final scores based on academic indicators like Attendance, Assignments, and Internal Test records. It utilizes AdaBoost Regression to improve prediction accuracy and compares the results against a standard Decision Tree.

Key Features

Synthetic Dataset: Simulates realistic student data (Attendance, Assignments, Internal Test) using Scikit-Learn.

Ensemble Learning: Implements AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) to combine multiple weak learners into a strong predictor.

Model Comparison: Evaluates and compares the MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of a single Decision Tree vs. AdaBoost.

Visualization: Includes a Matplotlib bar chart to visually demonstrate the error reduction achieved by the boosting algorithm.
